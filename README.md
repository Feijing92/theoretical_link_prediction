#  Link Prediction Theoretical Framework
In our paper, we introduce a new theoretical analysis method for general link prediction methods, in which the proposed local link prediction can be regarded as an approximation of classical link prediction. 
Further more, we give an error computing method for the error between local link prediction and classical link prediction.
In particular, we discussed nine local-topology-based link prediction algorithms based on the degree and the common neighbor.
In these cases, theoretical analysis can be soved by random graph tools and/or percolaton tools (generating functions).
